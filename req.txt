Okay, this sounds like a fantastic and innovative direction! Here's a Product Requirements Document (PRD) draft based on our discussion. I've aimed for simplicity and clarity, focusing on what's needed to build your "vibe-coded" document tool.

Product Requirements Document: VibeDoc (Working Title)

1. Introduction

VibeDoc is a next-generation, minimalist document tool designed to make content creation intuitive, fast, and intelligent. It re-imagines the document editor by empowering users to create and modify content blocks – from simple text to complex charts and tables – using natural language prompts. This "vibe coding" approach, combined with a clean interface and reactive capabilities, aims to remove the friction inherent in traditional document software.

2. Goals

To provide a highly intuitive and efficient way for users to create rich, structured documents.
To significantly reduce the time and effort spent on formatting and content structuring by leveraging AI.
To offer a focused, minimalist alternative to feature-laden traditional word processors, prioritizing user experience and core modern needs.
To enable dynamic and "live" document elements that can react to and reflect the content around them.
3. Target Audience

Individuals: Writers, students, researchers, knowledge workers, and anyone who frequently creates documents and seeks a more streamlined, AI-assisted process.
Teams (future focus): Small teams needing a quick way to draft, share, and iterate on documents like notes, proposals, and simple reports.
Primary User Profile: Tech-savvy or adaptable users comfortable with new interaction paradigms (like prompt-based interfaces) and who value efficiency and modern design.
4. Core Product Principles

Vibe Coding First: Natural language prompts are the primary method for creating, formatting, and transforming content within blocks.
Aggressive Minimalism: The UI will be clean, uncluttered, and free of unnecessary features. Focus is on the content and the prompt interaction.
Block-Based Everything: All content is structured as discrete, manageable, and AI-addressable blocks.
Intelligent & Reactive: Documents are not static. AI assists in content generation, and specific blocks can dynamically update based on document context.
5. Key Features & Requirements

5.1. Core Block-Based Editor
* [R1.1] Users must be able to add new blocks to the document (e.g., via slash command /, contextual button, or pressing Enter).
* [R1.2] Users must be able to delete blocks.
* [R1.3] Users must be able to reorder blocks (e.g., via drag-and-drop or keyboard shortcuts).
* [R1.4] The editor must support intuitive keyboard navigation between and within blocks.
* [R1.5] A persistent, easily accessible prompt interface (e.g., a command palette or contextual input) for "vibe coding" blocks.

5.2. Foundational "Vibe Coded" Content Blocks
* [R2.1] Text & Headings:
* Support for paragraph text and H1-H6 level headings.
* Creation and styling via prompt (e.g., "/h1 Main Title," select text -> "make heading 2").
* [R2.2] Lists:
* Support for bulleted, numbered, and checklist/to-do lists (interactive checkboxes).
* Creation and population via prompt (e.g., "/todo Action items from meeting notes...").
* [R2.3] Quotes & Callouts:
* Support for blockquotes and distinct callout boxes (e.g., info, warning, tip).
* Creation via prompt (e.g., "/quote [text]" or "/infobox Key takeaway: ...").
* [R2.4] Code Snippets:
* Display code with syntax highlighting for common programming languages.
* Creation via prompt (e.g., "/code python function for API call") or by pasting code and prompting for formatting/language.
* AI assistance: Prompt for comments, explanations, or simple refactoring of selected code block.
* [R2.5] Interactive Tables:
* Creation from prompt describing structure or from selected unstructured text (e.g., "/table 3 columns: Product, Price, Stock").
* AI-assisted population based on document context or further prompts.
* Basic frontend interactivity (e.g., column sorting).
* [R2.6] Interactive Graphs/Charts:
* Support for common chart types (bar, line, pie).
* Generation via prompt with inline data or referencing data elsewhere in the document (e.g., "/barchart Data: A=10, B=20, C=15").
* Basic frontend interactivity (e.g., tooltips on hover).
* [R2.7] Mathematical Equations:
* Display well-rendered math equations (e.g., using LaTeX).
* Creation via prompt (e.g., "/math E=mc^2").
* [R2.8] Dividers:
* Simple visual separator line, creatable via prompt (e.g., "/divider").

5.3. AI-Powered & Reactive Block Capabilities
* [R3.1] Smart Summaries: Generate concise summaries of selected text, sections, or the entire document via prompt (e.g., "/summarize section above").
* [R3.2] Content Transformation:
* Rephrase selected text (formal, casual, concise, expand) via prompt.
* Translate selected text to specified languages via prompt.
* [R3.3] Content Generation: Generate text for common needs (e.g., "/write intro paragraph for [topic]," "/brainstorm ideas for [subject]").
* [R3.4] Live Reactive Lists:
* Blocks that automatically populate and update based on the entire document's content.
* Examples: "List of sources and citations referenced," "List of all action items (@todo)," "List of questions raised."
* The prompt defines the "query" for the block (e.g., "/live_list all H2 headings").
* [R3.5] Document Q&A: Allow users to ask questions about the current document's content, with AI providing answers based on the text (e.g., "/ask What is the deadline for Project X?").

5.4. Document Management & Application Basics (Minimalist)
* [R4.1] Ability to create new documents, save documents, and open existing documents.
* [R4.2] AI-assisted document titling based on content.
* [R4.3] Simple list view for documents.
* [R4.4] Semantic search within a document and across all user documents (AI-powered).
* [R4.5] Export documents to Markdown and PDF formats.
* [R4.6] Basic user authentication and account management.

6. High-Level Technical Considerations

Framework: Likely Next.js for a unified frontend and backend (API routes) experience in TypeScript.
AI/LLM Integration:
Secure API integration with one or more LLM providers.
Robust prompt engineering and context management strategies.
Block Editor Engine: Selection or development of a block-based editor foundation (e.g., leveraging libraries like Tiptap/ProseMirror, Slate.js, or the open-source core of BlockNote.js, if suitable, or a well-scoped custom solution if absolutely necessary).
Document Model: A clear, serializable (likely JSON) structure for documents and blocks.
Reactivity System: A mechanism to detect document changes and trigger updates for reactive blocks.
Persistence: Database solution for storing user accounts and documents.
7. Success Metrics (How We'll Measure Success - Initial Thoughts)

User Adoption: Number of registered users and active users (daily/weekly/monthly).
Engagement: Average number of blocks created per session, average document length, frequency of "vibe-coded" block usage vs. manual methods (if any).
Task Completion Rate: Ability of users to successfully create desired document structures using prompts.
User Satisfaction: Qualitative feedback through surveys, interviews, and support channels.
Performance: Editor responsiveness, speed of AI-generated block rendering.
8. Out of Scope (For Initial Version - Maintaining Focus & Minimalism)

Real-time multi-user collaboration (e.g., Google Docs-style simultaneous editing).
Complex folder structures or advanced file organization features.
Extensive third-party app integrations.
Advanced document layout and print design options (beyond clean PDF export).
Offline mode.
Public API for third-party developers.
