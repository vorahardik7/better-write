Product Requirements Document: BetterWrite

1. Introduction

BetterWrite is a modern, AI-powered document editor that transforms how people write and edit documents. Unlike traditional word processors, BetterWrite focuses on intelligent text editing through natural language commands and AI assistance. Users select text and tell AI what they want to do with it - make it formal, fix grammar, summarize, or transform it in any way - and get instant, contextually-aware improvements.

2. Goals

To provide a streamlined alternative to Microsoft Word with AI superpowers that actually help users write better.
To eliminate the learning curve of complex formatting menus by using natural language commands.
To offer instant, intelligent text transformations that understand document context and user intent.
To create a modern, minimalist writing experience that prioritizes content over complex features.
To build an AI-native writing platform that remembers user style and context over time and supports high-stakes documents (research papers, resumes, proposals) with semantic search and retrieval.

3. Target Audience

Primary: Writers, students, researchers, knowledge workers, and professionals who frequently create documents and want AI assistance without complexity.
Secondary: Teams and individuals who value modern, efficient tools over feature-heavy traditional software.
User Profile: Tech-comfortable users who appreciate clean interfaces and AI-powered productivity tools.

4. Core Product Principles

AI-First Editing: Natural language commands are the primary way to transform and improve text.
Select-and-Command: Users select text, press âŒ˜K, and tell AI what they want to do with it.
Context-Aware Intelligence: AI understands the entire document context for better suggestions.
Minimalist Design: Clean, uncluttered interface focused on writing, not complex formatting options.
Instant Results: No menus, no learning curve - just select, command, and get results.
